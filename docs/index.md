# [Meld Encrypt](https://github.com/meld-cp/obsidian-encrypt) Plugin for Obsidian

**Create Encrypted Notes Within Your [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) Vault**

[Meld Encrypt](https://github.com/meld-cp/obsidian-encrypt) is a community plugin that lets you encrypt and decrypt your notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). You can choose to encrypt an [entire note](https://meld-cp.github.io/obsidian-encrypt/whole-encrypted-notes.html) or just [selected text within a note](https://meld-cp.github.io/obsidian-encrypt/in-place-encryption.html).

Encrypted notes are never decrypted to disk giving you peace-of-mind that the decrypted contents haven't been sync'd or backed up to external systems.

> [!WARNING]
> ⚠️ Use at Your Own Risk ⚠️
> - Your passwords are never stored. If you forget your password, your notes cannot be decrypted..
> - The encryption methods used have not been independently audited. Unauthorized access may be possible if someone gains access to your files.
> - Bugs may be introduced at any time. You are solely responsible for maintaining backups of your notes.
